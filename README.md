`Fullstack Typescript Developer`

I love to code in Typescript. Primary I code in Typescript, making server-side or fullstack apps. Fast typing enjoyer, see my **[monkeytype profile](https://monkeytype.com/profile/imexoodeex)**.

My favourite thing to code are fullstack applications using React Router v7 with my Dreamy UI library for beautiful UI! I love my apps due to very short time I can build them, simplicity, clean code and performance that latest technologies offer to us! In the future I'd like to publish my own stack and a few libraries to it.
